Chapter: 4

We implemented our own data service in the contactdataservice.js file.
This implemented our restful services to do with contacts.

We then also implemented an express application exposeContactService.js
This linked the incoming routes to the correct functions in contactdataservice

we must first run our instance of mongodb with: "mongod --dbpath ./data --rest" 
from within the base directory of the project.

we can then run this using "node exposeContactService.js"

we can then test the routes using postman.

The data will by default be empty so a put call must be made first.
in the post call you need to send a body like this:

{
    "primarycontactnumber": "contactString",
    "firstname": "firstnameString",
    "lastname": "lastnameString",
    "title": "titleString",
    "company": "companyString",
    "jobtitle": "jobtitleString",
    "othercontactnumbers": ["", "", ""],
    "primaryemailaddress": "emailString",
    "emailaddresses": ["", "", ""],
    "groups": ["", "", ""]
}
